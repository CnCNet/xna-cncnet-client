# Build & Package Workflow

This guide outlines the steps for updating, building, and packaging the `xna-cncnet-client` release for Red Alert 2: Yuriâ€™s Revenge and publishing a new version of the client for players.

## Updating the XNA CnCNet Client binaries for the package

1. **Download the latest client binaries release:**
   - Find the latest released client from [XNA CnCNet Client repo releases page](https://github.com/CnCNet/xna-cncnet-client/releases).
   - Download the `[xna-cncnet-client-X.Y.Z.7z]` file, inside of which the updated `Resources` folder should reside.
   - Make note of any migration steps noted in the release.

2. **Clean up old binaries folders:**
   - Go to your local `game-client-package` repo.
   - Go to
     `package/Resources/`
   - Delete `Binaries` and `BinariesNET8` to ensure that no obsolete/renamed library files remain.

3. **Paste files into the package repository:**
   - Go to your local `game-client-package` repo.
   - Unarchive `Resources` folder from `[xna-cncnet-client-X.Y.Z.7z]` file downloaded earlier into the folder:  
     `package/`  
   - You **must** get a prompt to replace `package/Resources/` folder and files inside it. If not, you're in the wrong directory.

4. **Apply the migration steps:**
   - If updating to next version: follow the instructions from release notes mentioned in step 1.
   - If updating skipping multiple versions, either:
     - look up all release notes skipped and apply migrations;
     - or refer to the [client docs on migration](https://github.com/CnCNet/xna-cncnet-client/blob/develop/Docs/Migration.md).

5. **Run the packaged client to test:**
   - Launch: `Yourclientlauncher.exe` on Windows or `Yourclientlauncher.sh` on Linux/Mac.
   - Verify the version hash and client version in the online lobby.
   - Does it work? If no - you missed some migration steps or screwed up somewhere in the steps above, verify your changes or start anew.

6. **Push changes:**
   - Create a new branch and push for review.
