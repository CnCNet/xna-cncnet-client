# Instructions on how to add Discord Rich Presence in XNA CnCNet client

About Discord Rich Presence
-----------------------------------
Discord Rich Presence (DRP) is a useful feature that allows Discord users to see what applications are open on their computer. For C&C players, this feature is especially important as the number of players decreases every year, and with DRP you can keep track of who is playing games and mods for the C&C series via the CnCNet client.

How to set up DRP for the client
-----------------------------------

Faction's logo, Random and Spectator logo should name as lowercase stings without spaces and apostrophes (they must pass by [RegExp](https://regexr.com) `[a-z]|[0-9]`), e.i.: `Nod Genesis Legion` must have `nodgenesislegion` logo name, `Yuri's Legi0n` must have `yurislegi0n` logo name. After you upload images click the **Save Changes** button and await authorization on server of your changes in application.
