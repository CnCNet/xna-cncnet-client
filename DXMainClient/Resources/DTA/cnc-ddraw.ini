; ### Optional settings ###
; Use the following settings to adjust the look and feel to your liking


; Stretch to custom resolution, 0 = defaults to the size game requests
width=0
height=0

; Override the width/height settings shown above and always stretch to fullscreen
; Note: Can be combined with 'windowed=true' to get windowed-fullscreen aka borderless mode
fullscreen=false

; Run in windowed mode rather than going fullscreen
windowed=false

; Maintain aspect ratio
maintas=false

; Windowboxing / Integer Scaling
boxing=false

; Real rendering rate, -1 = screen rate, 0 = unlimited, n = cap
; Note: Does not have an impact on the game speed, to limit your game speed use 'maxgameticks='
maxfps=-1

; Vertical synchronization, enable if you get tearing - (Requires 'renderer=auto/opengl*/direct3d9*')
; Note: vsync=true can fix tearing but it will cause input lag
vsync=false

; Automatic mouse sensitivity scaling
; Note: Only works if stretching is enabled. Sensitivity will be adjusted according to the size of the window
adjmouse=true

; Preliminary libretro shader support - (Requires 'renderer=opengl*') https://github.com/libretro/glsl-shaders
; 2x scaling example: https://imgur.com/a/kxsM1oY - 4x scaling example: https://imgur.com/a/wjrhpFV
; You can specify a full path to a .glsl shader file here or use one of the values listed below
; Possible values: Nearest neighbor, Bilinear, Bicubic, Lanczos, xBR-lv2
shader=Resources\Shaders\interpolation\catmull-rom-bilinear.glsl

; Window position, -32000 = center to screen
posX=-32000
posY=-32000

; Renderer, possible values: auto, opengl, openglcore, gdi, direct3d9, direct3d9on12 (auto = try direct3d9/opengl, fallback = gdi)
renderer=auto

; Developer mode (don't lock the cursor)
devmode=false

; Show window borders in windowed mode
border=true

; Save window position/size/state on game exit and restore it automatically on next game start
; Possible values: 0 = disabled, 1 = save to global 'ddraw' section, 2 = save to game specific section
savesettings=1

; Should the window be resizable by the user in windowed mode?
resizable=true

; Upscaling filter for the direct3d9* renderers
; Possible values: 0 = nearest-neighbor, 1 = bilinear, 2 = bicubic, 3 = lanczos (bicubic/lanczos only support 16/32bit color depth games)
d3d9_filter=2

; Enable upscale hack for high resolution patches (Supports C&C1, Red Alert 1 and KKND Xtreme)
vhack=false

; Switch between windowed/borderless modes with alt+enter rather than windowed/fullscreen modes
toggle_borderless=false

; Switch between windowed/fullscreen upscaled modes with alt+enter rather than windowed/fullscreen modes
toggle_upscaled=false



; ### Compatibility settings ###
; Use the following settings in case there are any issues with the game


; Hide WM_ACTIVATEAPP and WM_NCACTIVATE messages to prevent problems on alt+tab
noactivateapp=true

; Max game ticks per second, possible values: -1 = disabled, -2 = refresh rate, 0 = emulate 60hz vblank, 1-1000 = custom game speed
; Note: Can be used to slow down a too fast running game, fix flickering or too fast animations
; Note: Usually one of the following values will work: 60 / 30 / 25 / 20 / 15 (lower value = slower game speed)
maxgameticks=0

; Windows API Hooking, Possible values: 0 = disabled, 1 = IAT Hooking, 2 = Microsoft Detours, 3 = IAT+Detours Hooking (All Modules), 4 = IAT Hooking (All Modules)
; Note: Change this value if windowed mode or upscaling isn't working properly
; Note: 'hook=2' will usually work for problematic games, but 'hook=2' should be combined with renderer=gdi
hook=4

; Force minimum FPS, possible values: 0 = disabled, -1 = use 'maxfps=' value, -2 = same as -1 but force full redraw, 1-1000 = custom FPS
; Note: Set this to a low value such as 5 or 10 if some parts of the game are not being displayed (e.g. menus or loading screens)
minfps=-1

; Disable fullscreen-exclusive mode for the direct3d9*/opengl* renderers
; Note: Can be used in case some GUI elements like buttons/textboxes/videos/etc.. are invisible
nonexclusive=false

; Force CPU0 affinity, avoids crashes/freezing, *might* have a performance impact
; Note: Disable this if the game is not running smooth or there are sound issues
singlecpu=true

; Available resolutions, possible values: 0 = Small list, 1 = Very small list, 2 = Full list
; Note: Set this to 2 if your chosen resolution is not working or does not show up in the list
; Note: Set this to 1 if the game is crashing on startup
resolutions=0

; Child window handling, possible values: 0 = Disabled, 1 = Display top left, 2 = Display top left + repaint, 3 = Hide
; Note: Disables upscaling if a child window was detected (to ensure the game is fully playable, may look weird though)
fixchilds=2

; Enable one of the following settings if your cursor doesn't work properly when upscaling is enabled
hook_peekmessage=false
hook_getmessage=false


; Undocumented settings - You may or may not change these (You should rather focus on the settings above)
tshack=true
releasealt=false
game_handles_close=false
fixnotresponding=false
guard_lines=200
max_resolutions=0
limit_bltfast=false
lock_surfaces=false
allow_wmactivate=false
flipclear=false
fixmousehook=false
rgb555=false
no_dinput_hook=false
refresh_rate=0
anti_aliased_fonts_min_size=13
custom_width=0
custom_height=0
min_font_size=0
direct3d_passthrough=false



; ### Hotkeys ###
; Use the following settings to configure your hotkeys, 0x00 = disabled
; Virtual-Key Codes: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes


; Switch between windowed and fullscreen mode = [Alt] + [Enter]
keytogglefullscreen=0x0D

; Maximize window without frame = [Alt] + [Page Down]
keytogglemaximize=0x22

; Unlock cursor 1 = [Ctrl] + [Tab]
keyunlockcursor1=0x09

; Unlock cursor 2 = [Right Alt] + [Right Ctrl]
keyunlockcursor2=0xA3
