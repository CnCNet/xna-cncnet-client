# Configuration docs: https://gitversion.net/docs/reference/configuration
#
# This configuration will allow the gitversion msbuild task to auto version our executable. It uses existing tags
# to determine the next version by auto incrementing the Minor, Patch, or Tag version. The Tag version is calculated
# by counting the number of commits since the last tag.
# Patch version is incremented by 1 when a build is created from the develop or master branch.
#
# Examples:
#
# Latest tag is "2.8.0" - 
# The next commit on develop branch will start version 2.8.1-beta.1.
# That increments the Patch by 1. That also increments the beta by 1 for the 1 additional commit.
# Another commit creates 2.8.1-beta.2 and so on.
#
# Latest tag is "2.8.0-beta.1" - 
# The next commit on develop branch is "2.8.0-beta.2". Patch version is NOT incremented, because the 
# base tag of "2.8.0-beta.1" is also a beta.
# 
# Latest tag is "2.8.0" -
# A new commit is added directly to master. The new version is "2.8.1-rc.1".
# That increments the Patch, because it is treated as a "hotfix" directly on master.
#
# Versioning Modes Quick View:
# 
# Continuous Delivery: The default versioning mode. In this mode, GitVersion calculates the next version and will use that until that is released.
# Continuous Deployment: Sometimes you just want the version to keep changing and deploy continuously.
# In this case, Continuous Deployment is a good mode to operate GitVersion by.
